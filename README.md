# Robotic Arm with Force Feedback Control



## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a robotic arm with force feedback control, developed as an undergraduate thesis project at Tabriz University, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering under the supervision of Dr.Badamchizadeh. The project utilizes an Arduino microcontroller and a smart glove equipped with a dynamometer sensor to enable the robotic arm to apply force similar to a human hand.



## Components

1. **Arduino Microcontroller:** The core controller is responsible for managing the robotic arm's operations and interfacing with other components.

2. **Robotic Arm:** The mechanical structure comprising motors, joints, and grippers, controlled by the Arduino.

3. **Smart Glove:** Equipped with a dynamometer sensor to measure the force exerted by the human hand.

4. **Force Feedback Algorithm:** Software algorithm implemented on the Arduino to interpret sensor data and adjust the robotic arm's force accordingly.



## Setup Instructions:

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Please connect the robotic arm components (motors, grippers, etc.) to the Arduino board according to the circuit diagram provided in the documentation.
   - Ensure proper calibration and connection of the dynamometer sensor within the smart glove.

2. **Software Installation:**
   - Clone or download the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
   - Upload the Arduino sketch provided in the 'src' directory to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

3. **Configuration:**
   - Adjust any necessary parameters or constants in the Arduino sketch according to your specific hardware setup.
   - Calibrate the force feedback algorithm based on the dynamometer sensor readings to achieve desired performance.



## Usage

1. **Power On:**
   - Power on the Arduino board and ensure all connections are secure.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Follow the initialization procedure outlined in the documentation to calibrate the robotic arm and smart glove.

3. **Operating the Robotic Arm:**
   - Once initialized, the robotic arm should be ready to accept commands from the smart glove.
   - Wear the smart glove and exert force as desired to manipulate objects using the robotic arm.

4. **Adjustments:**
   - Fine-tune the force feedback algorithm parameters as necessary to optimize performance and achieve desired force control.
