# Robotic Arm with Force Feedback Control



## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a robotic arm with force feedback control, developed as an undergraduate thesis project at [University of Tabriz](https://tabrizu.ac.ir/en), Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering under the supervision of [Dr.Badamchizadeh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=edtNtXAAAAAJ&hl=en). The project utilizes an Arduino microcontroller and a smart glove equipped with an FSR sensor to enable the robotic arm to apply force similar to a human hand.



## Components

1. Arduino Microcontroller(at least UNO)
2. Robotic Arm
3. FSR sensors * 4  - [Purchase link for Iran](https://thecaferobot.com/store/forse-sensitive-resistor-fsr-402)
4. Servo motors * 6



## Setup Instructions:

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Please connect the robotic arm components (motors, grippers, etc.) to the Arduino board according to the circuit diagram provided in the documentation.
   - Ensure proper calibration and connection of the dynamometer sensor within the smart glove.

2. **Software Installation:**
   - Clone or download the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
   - Upload the Arduino sketch provided in the 'src' directory to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

3. **Configuration:**
   - Adjust any necessary parameters or constants in the Arduino sketch according to your specific hardware setup.
   - Calibrate the force feedback algorithm based on the dynamometer sensor readings to achieve the desired performance.
